## Reducing APK Size

Our library is built using native libraries. As a result, if you use the default gradle build you will generate an APK with all four architectures(armeabi-v7a, arm64-v8a, x86, x86_64) in your APK.

[APK splits](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits.html) allow developers to build multiple APKs for different screen sizes and ABIs. Enabling APK splits ensures that the minimum amount of files required to support a particular device are packaged into an APK.

The following snippet shows an example `build.gradle` with APK splits enabled.

    apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

    android {
        // Specify that we want to split up the APK based on ABI
        splits {
            abi {
                // Enable ABI split
                enable true

                // Clear list of ABIs
                reset()

                // Specify each architecture currently supported by the Voice SDK
                include "armeabi-v7a", "arm64-v8a", "x86", "x86_64"

                // Specify that we do not want an additional universal SDK
                universalApk false
            }
        }
    }

The adoption of APK splits requires developers to submit multiple APKs to the Play Store. Refer to [Googleâ€™s documentation](https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks.html)  for how to support this in your application.
