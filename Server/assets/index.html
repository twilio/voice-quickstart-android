    <header><h1>Hello Twilio Serverless!</h1></header>

    <main>
      <p>
        <strong>Congratulations</strong> you just started a new Twilio
        Serverless project.
      </p>

      <h2>Assets</h2>
      <p>
        Assets are static files, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images or audio
        files.
      </p>

      <p>
        This HTML page is an example of a <strong>public</strong> asset, you can
        access this by loading it in the browser. The HTML also refers to
        another public asset for CSS styles.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also have <strong>private</strong> assets, there is an example
        private asset called <code>message.private.js</code> in the
        <code>/assets</code> directory. This file cannot be loaded in the
        browser, but you can load it as part of a function by finding its path
        using <code>Runtime.getAssets()</code> and then requiring the file.
        There is an example of this in
        <code>/functions/private-message.js</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        Functions are JavaScript files that will respond to incoming HTTP
        requests. There are <strong>public</strong> and
        <strong>protected</strong> functions.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Public</strong> functions respond to all HTTP requests. There is
        an example of a public function in
        <code>/functions/hello-world.js</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Protected</strong> functions will only respond to HTTP requests
        with a valid Twilio signature in the header. You can read more about
        <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/security#validating-requests"
          >validating requests from Twilio in the documentation</a
        >. There is an example of a protected function in
        <code>/functions/sms/reply.protected.js</code>
      </p>

      <h2>twilio-run</h2>

      <p>
        Functions and assets are served, deployed and debugged using
        <a href="https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-run"
          ><code>twilio-run</code></a
        >. You can serve the project locally with the command
        <code>npm start</code> which is really running
        <code>twilio-run --env</code> under the hood. If you want to see what
        else you can do with <code>twilio-run</code> enter
        <code>npx twilio-run --help</code> on the command line or check out
        <a href="https://github.com/twilio-labs/twilio-run"
          >the project documentation on GitHub</a
        >.
